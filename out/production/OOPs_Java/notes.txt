

-> a constructor defines what will happen when a object is created

-> constructor is a function which have some argumnets, that runs when you create a new object and it alloctes some variables

FINAL

-> final keyword must be declared while it is being initialise
-> final keyword do only works with the primitive data types

-> in case of non primitive datatypes you cannot reassign the variables

final oop1.Intro.Student name = new oop1.Intro.Student();
oop1.Intro.Student one = name                    -> this is not allowed




STATIC            ---->    do not depend upon objects

the static keyword in java is used to declare the attributes or classes in java which are not dependent on any of the individual
objects.

static -> this static key word can be accessed even if we do not declare or initialise a class or object;

to access the class we have to first create an object of the class.
that's why to access the functions of the main class we have to put static before the main funtion.


a static method can only access static data, it cannot access a non static data.
static methods or classes are not dependent on objects
